## Lambda Expression:

A lambda expression (lambda) describes a block of code (an anonymous function) that can be passed to constructors or methods for subsequent execution. The constructor or method receives the lambda as an argument. 
**Consider the following example:**

```java
(parameter1, parameter2) -> { code block }
```
